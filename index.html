                        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                        <div class="body-text">
                            <p>It started off with me being late class back in Highschool where the travel time was very long and traffic, atrocious even by car. Better yet,
                                sometimes I would have to beg my teacher to see if I can leave the class early just so that I can make it to the bus to get home before it
                                leaves 10 minutes after school ended. </p>

                            <p>Being late was still a thing a thing when I was in university. Either it was the busses no coming or canceled or traffic, or sometimes even both.
                                I've nearly had enough of being late several times a week, it was just tiring to deal with. </p>
                            
                            <p>But when portals and teleportation was discovered, everything for me changed. Knowing that I was top  in the field of quantum tunnels in my university
                                class, I knew I had to do something. After finishing my masters weeks after the discovery I immediately applied to the company that discovered it.
                                I was accepted in. A few years have gone by, learnt more things then I could ever dream of.  An opportunity arose when the company wanted to create a
                                subsidiary focusing on travel and how this new technology could be utilized. With years under my belt, I was appointed head.</p>
                            
                            <p>And that's how port was created </p>

                            <p>Now port is in the small testing phase or our project and ironing things out. We currently have around a few hundred beta tester including our staff
                                member located in Auckland New Zealand helping us improve our service.</p>
                            
                            <p>More is yet to come from Port and to everyone else.</p>

                            a connection with your phone, portal, then the destination to do final checks. Finally, the portal is set and
                            ready for you to walk through.</p>
